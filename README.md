# Image Processing Project Tasks

## Task 1

The model is YOLO object detection and opencv stitching algorithm. Please download the yolo weights and provide its path before running the code.

## Task 2

I used HoughCircles function and tuned hyper-parameters to accurately detect and predict the number of pipes.

## Task 3

The model is Single shot learning, it contains many files. Please contact me for further details.
